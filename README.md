# Counting fingers using python & Open CV
Using Python3 and Opencv, detect the both hands and counting the fingers by live video.

In Internet many articles there for counting fingers with Hand Tracking. The resultant count of fingers are stand-up is showed on the video 
it self, which is based on their personal preference.I didn't saw any post related to track both hands and count fingers.
So, i decided to make this.

steps to run the:
1. Create new virtual environment, Here using conda environment, to create "conda create -n hand_track python=3.8"
2. Activate the environment using "conda activate hand_track"
3. Change the directory to location of python files using "cd" command
4. To install requirements with this "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. Run the python file using "python finger_count.py"
6. Webcam is opened and capture the video from your Webcam
7. show the hands to webcam (most of the time hide your head), it detect and show the no.of fingers are stand/up.

Note: Find the Resultant snapshot.
